2. for i from 0 to CVFolds
    Select LearningData
    Select TestingData
    *** Is this where we select the features???
    For f from 1 to TotalFeatures #f=features
        CurrentFeatures = (feature[0] to feature[f])
        LearningData = LearningData.Rows(features from 0 to f)
        TestingData = TestingData.Rows(features from 0 to f)
        For k from 3 to 30 in increments of 3
             to Stats append Run KNN using k, CurrentFeatures
             #Stats needs to store, value of k, selected features, accuracy, TruePositive(TP), FalsePositive(FP), FalseNegative(FN), TrueNegative(TN)
             to Stats append CalculatePerformanceMetric
                #CalculatePerformanceMetric will use TP,FP,FN,TN to add the following columns: Accuracy, TPR, FPR, Precision, and the NPV
